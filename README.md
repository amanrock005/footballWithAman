## Still work in progress

This repo contains what I've learnt so far about football. 
It will also include source code of various apps which I've build to take my football to the next level. 

### Note
1. Football doesn't have a rigid blue print that must be followed all the time. Taking the scenarior into account the correct decision to make will vary and there is no right answer because sometime incorrect decision can help to score a goal.
2. The content of this repository represents my personal opinions and insights developed through years of experience playing football.
